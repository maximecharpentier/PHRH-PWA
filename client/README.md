## Technical choices

### 1. React

We use `React` for its similarity to **JS object prototyping** and its
few integrated **development tools** directly into the starter. 

It's a **popular** and **effective** framework, with a **huge community**, so no harm in **taking over and developing** the project in the future.

### 2. styled-components

We use `styled-components` for its ability to make the **style dynamic** by passing parameters **directly in the stylesheets integrated in JS**.

### 3. Axios

We use `Axios` because it's a **simplier** and **developer-friendly** API fetcher than `fetch`, and much more **configurable**.
